# Sudoku-Solver

This project focuses on solving a Sudoku puzzle using a genetic algorithm. Sudoku is a puzzle based on a small set of simple rules: each square must contain a single number, only numbers 1 through 9 can be used, each 3x3 box can only contain each number once, and each vertical column can only contain each number once.

## Objectives

1. **Defining Genetic Algorithm Terms:**
   - Establishing clear definitions for crucial terms such as `Gene` and `Chromosome`.

2. **Initial Population Construction:**
   - Forming the initial population of candidate solutions for the genetic algorithm.

3. **Fitness Function:**
   - Defining and implementing a `Fitness Function` to evaluate the fitness of potential solutions.

4. **Crossover and Mutation:**
   - Implementing the processes of `Crossover` and `Mutation`, vital to the genetic algorithm's evolution and convergence.

5. **Algorithm Execution:**
   - Running the genetic algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles effectively.

By achieving these goals, we seek to showcase the potential and effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms in solving Sudoku puzzles, highlighting their application in optimization and search problems.
